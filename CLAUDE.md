# CLAUDE.md — VoiceFirst ESL Hackathon Project

## Project Overview

A voice-first English learning web app for Rohingya refugees and newcomers with low literacy who are training to work as caregivers.
The core insight: **traditional ESL apps fail because they assume users can read**. This app
teaches English entirely through audio, voice repetition, and real-world conversation scenarios.

**Hackathon mantra:** Build one clean learning loop that works flawlessly.
`Hear → Repeat → Sentence → Conversation → Photo Learning → Real-World Practice`

**Target Users:** Rohingya refugees and newcomers preparing for caregiver roles in healthcare, elder care, and home support services.

## Winning Demo Script

> "Many Rohingya newcomers cannot use traditional ESL apps because they rely on reading.
> Our system teaches English entirely through voice using real-life situations like grocery
> stores, transportation, workplaces, and **caregiving scenarios**. Since many of our users
> will work as caregivers, we focus on emergency situations, patient communication, and
> daily caregiving tasks. Users can also **snap photos of real objects** — medicine bottles,
> medical equipment, household items — and our AI identifies them, teaches the vocabulary
> through voice, and creates personalized quizzes based on their photos."

Demo flow for judges:
1. Choose caregiver theme
2. Learn word: **medicine** (audio plays, image shown)
3. Repeat sentence: **"I give medicine"**
4. Practice caregiver conversation (emergency scenario)
5. **Snap photo of medicine bottle → AI identifies "aspirin" → Voice teaches word → Quiz created**
6. Show progress tracker

## Learning System — 5 Stages

### Stage 1 — Words
- ElevenLabs voices the word slowly (e.g., "Bread.")
- Optional: image displayed
- User taps mic, repeats word
- ElevenLabs transcribes, backend checks match

### Stage 2 — Sentences
- Same word placed in 1–2 simple sentences
- Example: "I buy bread." / "I eat bread."
- ElevenLabs plays sentence
- User repeats, ElevenLabs transcribe checks

### Stage 3 — Conversations
- Short scripted dialogue for a real-world setting
- App plays the "worker" side via ElevenLabs
- User responds with their line
- Example (Grocery):
  ```
  Worker: Hello
  User: Hello
  Worker: What do you want?
  User: I want bread
  ```

### Stage 4 — Mini Story (nice-to-have)
- Words appear in a short narrative chain
- Example: "I go to the store. I buy bread. I pay. I go home."
- Context chaining aids memory

### Stage 5 — Real-life Mission (nice-to-have)
- System suggests 3 sentences to use in the real world today
- Example: "I want bread." / "I need help." / "Where is the bus?"

## API Reference

### POST `/lesson/start`
Begin a lesson session.
```json
// Request
{
  "theme": "grocery",
  "goal_words": 20,
  "days": 7
}
// Response
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "first_word": "bread"
}
```

### GET `/lesson/word?theme=grocery&session_id=abc123`
Get next word for the current lesson.
```json
// Response
{
  "word": "bread",
  "image": "/images/bread.png",
  "sentence_examples": [
    "I buy bread",
    "I eat bread"
  ]
}
// NOTE: audio is fetched via GET /tts/bread — frontend constructs this URL via ttsUrl()
```

### GET `/lesson/conversation?theme=grocery`
Get a scripted conversation for a theme.
```json
// Response
{
  "theme": "grocery",
  "turns": [
    { "speaker": "worker", "line": "Hello" },

```

### GET `/tts/:text`
Stream ElevenLabs TTS audio as MP3 for any text.
```
GET /tts/bread          → streams audio/mpeg
GET /tts/I%20buy%20bread → streams audio/mpeg
```
Frontend uses `ttsUrl(text)` from `lib/api.ts` to construct these URLs.

  "similarity": 0.95
}
```

## Key Implementation Notes

**ElevenLabs STT speech check:** Use fuzzy string matching (not exact). A score >= 0.75 should count
as correct. The user is a non-native speaker — be forgiving.

**ElevenLabs voice:** Use a calm, slow, clear voice. Slow down the `speed` parameter if the
API supports it. Clarity matters more than naturalness here.

**Mic UX:** The mic button must be dead simple — one big button, clear recording indicator,
auto-submit on silence or tap. Do not add complexity here.

**No text walls in UI:** Minimal text on screen. Large icons, big audio play buttons, visual
progress bars. The user may not be able to read English.

**Offline fallback:** Pre-generate and cache ElevenLabs audio for the word bank so demos work
without live API calls if internet drops during the hackathon presentation.

## What Wins Hackathons

A half-broken AI super-system loses to a smooth, focused demo every time.

The judges need to feel the product in 3 minutes:
1. They hear the voice
2. They see someone speak into the mic
3. They see "Correct!" feedback
4. They see the progress bar move

If those 4 moments are polished, you win.
